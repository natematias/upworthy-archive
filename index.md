# The Upworthy Research Archive

* [J. Nathan Matias](https://natematias.com), *Assistant Professor, Cornell University: co-lead*
* [Kevin Munger](http://www.kevinmunger.com/), *Assistant Professor, Penn State University: co-lead*

* [Charles Ebersole](http://charlesrebersole.weebly.com/), *Postdoc, University of Virginia: data controller*

**The Upworthy Research Archive is an open dataset of thousands of A/B tests of headlines conducted by Upworthy from January 2013 to April 2015.** At the time of release, it is the largest open-access collection of randomized behavioral studies openly available for research and education. We hope it doesn't stay that way for long (see below if you wish to contribute data).

We have published a data descriptor with Nature Scientific Data that fully describes the dataset and includes validation information:

* Matias, J., Munger, K., Aubin Le Quere, M., Ebersole, C. (2021) **[The Upworthy Research Archive, a time series of 32,487 experiments in U.S. media](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00934-7).** Nature Scientific Data.

## In the News
* Original project announcement: **[Announcing the Upworthy Research Archive: Help us advance human understanding by studying this massive dataset of headline A/B tests](https://natematias.medium.com/announcing-the-upworthy-research-archive-c9b11087ddeb)**

## What can I do with the Upworthy Research Archive?

We hope this dataset will be used in three ways: to conduct academic research, to serve as an resource for educators, and to inform the implementation of A/B tests by organizations.

We expect that this dataset will help advance knowledge in many fields, including:

* **Political Science, Communication, Psychology, and Marketing** theories on the language that influences people to click on articles
* **Organizational Behavior** research on how firms learn over time (or not) through experimentation
* **Statistical** advances on the analysis of experiments
* **Computer Science** research in machine learning and cybersecurity
* **Meta-scientific questions** about the knowledge from behavioral experiments and how useful they are at predicting future outcomes

## What is the structure of the data? 

**[About the Archive](about-the-archive)** contains a full description of the data, references and slides.

## Confirmatory Research with the Upworthy Research Archive

Multiple comparisons and overfitting represent serious risks to scientific understanding with a dataset of this size. By doing the extra work of supporting cross-validation, we hope to maximize the amount of highly-credible science that results from this this dataset. For that reason, we have structured the data to support researchers to develop registered reports for research projects.

We are providing an **Exploratory Dataset** of 4,873 experiments to support academic research and teaching. For researchers who plan to conduct confirmatory research that tests hypotheses, we are keeping a larger **Confirmatory Dataset** of 22,743 experiments in reserve. During the period until we released the dataset publicly in August 2021, we also retained a holdout dataset for a meta-scientific study with the Center for Open Science.

The full dataset, with all parts, may now be accessed on the Open Science Framework at [https://osf.io/jd64p/]( https://osf.io/jd64p/)

## What is a Registered Report?

To learn more, see [the Center for Open Science introduction to registered reports](https://cos.io/rr/).

Generally, Registered Reports are form of "results-blind" peer review. A journal will evaluate the submission in terms of the appropriateness of the analysis strategy for addressing the theoretical question.

With the Upworthy Research Archive, researchers can use the Exploratory Dataset to understand the structure of the data and write code to analyze it. Journals will then review the scientific merit of the Registered Report, and if they agree to publish it, the code can be run on the Confirmatory dataset to produce the final results.

To date, 242 academic journals have published Registered Reports. The full list can be found [here,](https://cos.io/rr/) under the "Participating Journals" tab.


## I operate a publisher and want to add to the archive by donating our historical A/B tests
We live in a time of unprecedented behavioral research by news publishers, advertisers, and tech companies. By donating your historical A/B tests, you can contribute to education and to breakthroughs across multiple scientific fields. 

Our team can help you assess the potential scientific value of your archives and chart a privacy-preserving way to contribute to open knowledge. Please contact J. Nathan Matias &lt;<nathan.matias@cornell.edu>&gt; if this interests you.
