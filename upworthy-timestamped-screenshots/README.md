# Upworthy timestamped screenshots
To help with the interpretation of the A/B test data, we provide timestamped screenshots of what Upworthy's website looked like between 2013-2015. 
About these screenshots:
   * These screenshots were all retrieved from [archive.is](archive.is)
   * The format for each screenshot name is `YYYY.MM_clickabilitytestid.png`
      * If the page at the time that a screenshot was taken exceeds the size of the screenshot, 
      the first half of the web page will be labelled `YYYY.MM_1_clickabilitytestid.png` and the second half
      of the web page will be labelled `YYYY.MM_2_clickabilitytestid.png`
   * The screenshots are of article pages. We include article pages because that is where the tests were taking place.
   * Employees that worked at Upworthy during this time period have let us know that the tests were primarily running in the sidebar and below the articles.
